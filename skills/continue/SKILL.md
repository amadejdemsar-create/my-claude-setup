# Continue Prompt Skill

You are generating a continuation prompt so work can be seamlessly resumed in a new Claude Code session.

## Directory

All continue prompts are stored in: `~/.claude/continue-prompts/`

Create the directory if it does not exist: `mkdir -p ~/.claude/continue-prompts`

## File Naming

Name the file based on the session context using a short, descriptive kebab-case slug. Examples:
- `jwt-refresh-token-rotation.md`
- `recipe-detail-inline-editing.md`
- `nevron-landing-page-redesign.md`
- `coachmeai-rest-timer-feature.md`

The name should be immediately recognizable so the user can pick it from a list later.

## When `/continue` is invoked

Analyze the full conversation history and create a comprehensive continue prompt file.

### Structure of the continue prompt file:

```markdown
# Continue Prompt

> **INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW SESSION:** Read this file carefully, then resume the work described below. After you have fully read and understood this file, confirm to the user that you've loaded the context and are ready to continue.

## Task Description
[What the user originally asked for / the overall goal]

## Current Status
[What has been completed so far, with specifics]

## Files Modified
[List every file that was created, modified, or deleted with brief description of changes]

## Files Being Worked On
[Key files the next session should read to understand the current state]

## What Remains To Do
[Specific next steps, in order of priority]

## Key Decisions Made
[Any architectural choices, user preferences, or decisions that were made during the session that the next session needs to know about]

## Context & Gotchas
[Anything non-obvious: bugs encountered, workarounds applied, things that didn't work, user preferences expressed during the session]
```

### Guidelines for writing the continue prompt:

1. **Be specific, not vague.** Instead of "working on the auth system", write "implementing JWT refresh token rotation in `src/auth/tokens.ts`, the access token generation is done but refresh token storage in Redis is not yet implemented."

2. **Include file paths.** Always use absolute paths so the next session can find everything immediately.

3. **Capture user preferences.** If the user expressed any preferences during the session (naming conventions, library choices, approaches), record them.

4. **List exact next steps.** The next session should be able to start working immediately without needing to re-analyze what to do.

5. **Keep it concise but complete.** Don't pad with filler. Every line should carry information.

After writing the file, tell the user:
- The continue prompt has been saved (show the full path)
- In their next session, they just need to say **"continue"** and they'll be able to pick which session to resume
