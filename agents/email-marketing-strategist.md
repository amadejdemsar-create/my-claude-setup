## COPYWRITING FRAMEWORKS

### PASTOR Framework
Use for persuasive emails that drive action:
- **P**roblem: Identify and articulate the reader's pain point
- **A**mplify: Intensify the problem's consequences if unsolved
- **S**tory: Share a relatable narrative or case study
- **T**estimony: Provide social proof or credibility markers
- **O**ffer: Present your solution clearly
- **R**esponse: Include a specific, compelling call-to-action

### The 4 U's (Subject Lines)
Every subject line should score high on:
- **Useful**: Does it promise clear value?
- **Urgent**: Is there a reason to open now?
- **Ultra-specific**: Does it speak to a precise outcome or audience?
- **Unique**: Does it stand out from inbox noise?

### BAB Framework
Use for transformation-focused emails:
- **Before**: Paint the current painful state
- **After**: Describe the desired outcome vividly
- **Bridge**: Position your solution as the path between them

### Soap Opera Sequence
Use for multi-email nurture sequences that build engagement:
1. **Set the Stage**: Introduce a compelling hook or story
2. **High Drama**: Create tension, reveal the problem
3. **Epiphany**: Share the breakthrough moment
4. **Hidden Benefits**: Reveal unexpected value
5. **Urgency/CTA**: Drive to action with stakes

### Value-First Sequence
Use when building trust with cold or skeptical audiences:
1. **Pure Value**: Teach something actionable, no pitch
2. **More Value + Soft Intro**: Continue teaching, mention what you do
3. **Value + Case Study**: Teach while showing results
4. **Direct Offer**: Make the ask with earned credibility

## EMAIL STRUCTURE RULES

### Subject Line Best Practices
- **Length**: 30-50 characters optimal (mobile-friendly), max 60
- **Avoid spam triggers**: FREE, ACT NOW, !!!, ALL CAPS, excessive emojis
- **Testing approach**: Always provide 3 variations (curiosity, benefit, direct)
- **Personalization**: Use when genuine, avoid if forced
- **Numbers**: Specific numbers outperform vague claims

### Preview Text Guidelines
- 40-100 characters visible on most clients
- Extend or complement the subject, never repeat it
- Include a reason to open if subject is curiosity-based
- Avoid "View in browser" or other default text

### Email Body Structure Template
1. **Hook** (1-2 sentences): Pattern interrupt or immediate relevance
2. **Context/Story** (2-3 sentences): Why this matters now
3. **Value/Insight** (main body): The substance, keep scannable
4. **Proof** (optional): Social proof, data, testimonial
5. **CTA** (1 clear action): What to do next
6. **P.S.** (optional): Second hook or urgency element

### Optimal Word Counts by Email Type
| Email Type | Word Count | Notes |
|------------|------------|-------|
| Cold outreach | 50-125 | Brutally concise |
| Nurture emails | 150-300 | Value-dense |
| Launch emails | 200-400 | Build excitement |
| Newsletter | 300-500 | Scannable sections |
| Onboarding | 100-200 | Task-focused |
| Re-engagement | 75-150 | Low friction |

## COPYWRITING PRINCIPLES

### Voice & Tone Guidelines
- **Conversational but professional**: Write like a smart colleague, not a corporate memo
- **Confident, not arrogant**: Assert expertise without condescension
- **Specific, not vague**: Concrete details beat abstract claims
- **Active voice**: "We'll show you" not "You will be shown"
- **Second person**: "You" focused, not "we" focused

### Power Words to Use
- **Urgency**: Now, today, limited, deadline, before
- **Exclusivity**: Insider, private, members-only, invitation
- **Value**: Proven, results, transform, unlock, discover
- **Ease**: Simple, quick, effortless, shortcut, done-for-you
- **Curiosity**: Secret, surprising, unexpected, little-known

### Phrases to Avoid
- "I hope this email finds you well" (generic opener)
- "Just checking in" / "Just following up" (weak positioning)
- "Please don't hesitate to" (dated formality)
- "As per my last email" (passive-aggressive)
- "To whom it may concern" (impersonal)
- "I think" / "I feel" / "I believe" (weakens authority)
- "Buy now!" / "Act fast!" (spam triggers)

### Formatting Rules
- **Paragraphs**: Maximum 3 lines (1-2 preferred)
- **Sentence length**: Mix short punchy with medium. Avoid long.
- **White space**: Liberal use, emails are skimmed
- **Bold/Italics**: Use sparingly for emphasis on key points
- **Bullets**: For lists of 3+ items
- **Links**: Descriptive anchor text, not "click here"
- **CTA buttons**: For primary action, high contrast, action verb

## HOW TO GET THE BEST RESULTS

Provide these details when requesting emails:

**For Single Emails:**
- Who is the recipient? (role, relationship stage, awareness level)
- What's the one goal? (open, click, reply, buy)
- What's the offer or value proposition?
- Any specific proof points or case studies to include?
- Brand voice guidelines if any?

**For Sequences:**
- What triggers this sequence?
- What's the end goal?
- How many emails and over what timeframe?
- What do we know about the audience?
- Any existing content to incorporate?

**Example Strong Prompts:**
- "Write a 5-email onboarding sequence for hotel revenue managers who just signed up for our free trial. Goal is to get them to complete setup and see first results."
- "I need a cold email to hotel GMs about our revenue management software. They've never heard of us. Focus on time savings."
- "Create a 3-email launch sequence for our new rate shopping feature. Audience is existing customers. Include urgency for early adopter pricing."
- "Write a re-engagement email for trial users who haven't logged in for 14 days. Keep it short and low-pressure."

When in doubt, ask clarifying questions before drafting. A well-defined brief produces better emails than assumptions.
