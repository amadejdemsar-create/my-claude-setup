# Geopolitical Analysis Framework

## Core Principle
Markets are forward-looking. By the time geopolitical events are headline news, much of the price impact has already occurred. The value is in:
1. Identifying risks before they're priced in
2. Understanding second and third-order effects
3. Separating noise (short-term volatility) from signal (structural shifts)

## Trade & Tariffs

### Framework
- **First-order**: Tariff on X → price of X rises → domestic producers benefit, consumers pay more
- **Second-order**: Trading partner retaliates → exports to that country fall → ag/industrial exposure
- **Third-order**: Supply chains restructure → winners are alternative sourcing countries (Vietnam, India, Mexico)

### Key Relationships
- **US-China**: The defining geopolitical relationship. Watch Taiwan Strait, tech export controls, trade balance. Any escalation = semiconductors, consumer electronics, rare earths affected
- **US-EU**: Generally aligned but compete on tech regulation, agriculture, defense spending
- **BRICS+**: Watch for de-dollarization moves. Slow but directional. Benefits gold, BTC as alternative stores of value

### Sector Impacts
- Tariffs on China: Semis (NVDA, AMD export restrictions), consumer electronics (Apple supply chain), solar, EV batteries
- Tariffs on EU: Autos, agriculture, luxury goods
- Tariffs on Mexico/Canada: Auto manufacturing (USMCA), agriculture, energy

## Energy Geopolitics

### Oil Price Chain Reaction
Oil price spike → Transportation costs up → Goods inflation → Consumer spending pressured → Central bank must choose between growth and inflation → Usually chooses to fight inflation → Rate hikes → Economy slows

### Key Actors
- **OPEC+**: Supply decisions directly impact oil price. Saudi Arabia is the swing producer. Watch production quotas and compliance
- **US shale**: Breakeven $40-60/bbl for most producers. Below breakeven = rigs shut down = supply response. Above $80 = drilling accelerates
- **Russia**: Major gas supplier to Europe (reduced post-2022). Oil revenues fund war capability. Sanctions create price floors via reduced supply
- **Iran/Venezuela**: Sanctioned producers. Any relaxation = supply boost = oil price pressure

### Energy Transition Impact
- Short-term: Fossil fuels still dominate. Underinvestment in oil exploration = supply constraints = structurally higher oil prices
- Medium-term: EV adoption accelerating. Peak oil demand debate (2030-2040?)
- Long-term: Renewable buildout requires massive copper, lithium, rare earth investment = commodity supercycle thesis
- Nuclear renaissance: AI data center power demands pushing nuclear back into favor (uranium, SMR technology)

## Technology Control

### Semiconductor Supply Chain
- **Taiwan (TSMC)**: Manufactures ~90% of advanced chips (<7nm). Single point of failure for global tech
- **ASML (Netherlands)**: Only maker of EUV lithography machines. Chokepoint for advanced chip manufacturing
- **Export controls**: US restricts sales of advanced chips/equipment to China. China developing domestic alternatives (SMIC) but years behind
- **Investment impact**: Chip equipment stocks (ASML, AMAT, LRCX, KLA) benefit from BOTH sides building capacity. Foundries (TSMC, Samsung, Intel) in capex arms race

### AI Regulation
- **EU AI Act**: Most comprehensive. Risk-based classification. Compliance costs for US tech companies operating in EU
- **US approach**: Lighter touch, executive orders. Export controls on AI chips to adversaries
- **China**: Strict content control but accelerating AI development. DeepSeek showing competitive capability at lower cost
- **Impact**: Regulation creates moats for incumbents (compliance costs barrier to entry) but limits growth vectors

### Data Sovereignty
- Countries requiring data stored locally → benefits local cloud providers and data center builders
- Impact on US hyperscalers (AWS, Azure, GCP): Must build local infrastructure, increases capex, margin pressure in some regions

## Sanctions & Capital Flows

### How Sanctions Create Opportunities
- **Forced selling**: When a country/entity is sanctioned, their assets in Western markets must be liquidated → creates temporary dislocation in affected stocks/bonds
- **Capital redirection**: Money that can't flow to sanctioned destinations goes elsewhere → benefits neutral countries (India, UAE, Turkey)
- **Commodity disruption**: Sanctions on commodity producers (Russia oil, Iranian oil) reduce supply → price spikes → benefts non-sanctioned producers

### Safe Haven Flows During Geopolitical Stress
1. **US Treasuries**: First destination in crisis
2. **Gold**: Physical scarcity, no counterparty risk
3. **Swiss Franc**: Neutral, stable economy
4. **USD**: Reserve currency status (for now)
5. **Bitcoin**: Increasingly considered digital gold by institutional investors
6. **Japanese Yen**: Carry trade unwind destination

## Election Cycles

### US Presidential Cycle
- **Year 1 (post-inauguration)**: Historically weakest. New policies, uncertainty. Average S&P return: +6%
- **Year 2 (midterm)**: Second weakest. Midterm election uncertainty. Average: +7%
- **Year 3 (pre-election)**: Historically strongest. Incumbent stimulates economy. Average: +16%
- **Year 4 (election year)**: Moderate. Uncertainty until outcome clear. Average: +7%

### Policy Impact by Party (Historical Tendencies)
- **Republican**: Corporate tax cuts (broad market boost), deregulation (financials, energy), defense spending up, fossil fuel friendly
- **Democrat**: Higher corporate taxes (near-term headwind), regulation (pharma, banks, tech), clean energy investment, infrastructure spending, social spending
- **Divided government**: Markets often like this -- limits extreme policy. Gridlock = stability

### Key: Markets Hate Uncertainty
- Contested elections = extended volatility (2000 Gore v Bush)
- Clear mandates = quick repricing to new policy expectations
- Sector rotation happens fast after election night

## Regional Conflicts

### Supply Chain Risk Assessment Framework
For any conflict, ask:
1. **What is produced/shipped through this region?**
   - Taiwan Strait: Semiconductors (90% advanced chips)
   - Red Sea/Suez: 12% of global trade, 30% of container shipping
   - Strait of Hormuz: 20% of global oil
   - Ukraine/Black Sea: Grain (wheat, corn), sunflower oil, neon gas (chip manufacturing)
2. **What's the probability of disruption?** (Low/Medium/High)
3. **What's the duration if disrupted?** (Days, months, years?)
4. **Who benefits from the disruption?** (Alternative suppliers, transport routes)
5. **Is it priced in?** (Check implied vol, commodity futures curve)

### Investment Response to Conflicts
- **Initial spike**: Defense stocks, oil, gold, volatility. Usually overdone in first 48 hours
- **After 1-2 weeks**: Market assesses real economic impact. If contained, spike reverses
- **Structural shift**: If conflict changes trade routes or supply chains permanently, the sector re-rating is durable

## Regulatory Shifts

### SEC & Financial Regulation
- Enforcement cycles: Aggressive SEC = near-term headwind for crypto, SPACs, IPOs. Permissive = innovation boom (and eventual excess)
- Crypto: Watch for ETF approvals (bullish catalyst), stablecoin regulation (could legitimize or restrict), exchange enforcement (short-term pain, long-term maturation)
- Antitrust: Big tech breakup threats. Rarely succeed but create volatility and cap multiples

### ESG & Climate Regulation
- Carbon border taxes (EU CBAM): Impacts carbon-intensive imports
- Disclosure requirements: Increases compliance costs, benefits ESG data providers
- Transition mandates: Timelines for ICE vehicle bans, coal phase-out. Creates forced capex cycles
