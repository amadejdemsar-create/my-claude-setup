# Crypto-Specific Analysis Frameworks

## On-Chain Metrics

### Network Activity
- **Active addresses (daily/monthly)**: Growing = real adoption. Stagnant/declining = narrative-only project. Compare to token price -- divergence is a signal
- **Transaction count & volume**: Raw transaction count less useful (can be gamed). Dollar-denominated volume more meaningful. Organic volume vs wash trading distinction is critical
- **New addresses**: Leading indicator. Spike in new addresses = new users discovering the protocol. Sustained growth > spike then decline
- **Retention**: What % of addresses that transact in month 1 are still active in month 3, 6, 12? This is the metric most projects hide because it's ugly

### Valuation Metrics
- **NVT Ratio (Network Value to Transactions)**: Market cap / daily transaction volume (on-chain). Crypto equivalent of P/E. High NVT = overvalued relative to usage. Low NVT = undervalued or growing into usage. BTC historical range: 20-100
- **MVRV Ratio (Market Value to Realized Value)**: Market cap / realized cap (sum of each coin's value at last movement price). >3.5 = historically overvalued (profit-taking zone). <1.0 = historically undervalued (accumulation zone). One of the most reliable cycle indicators for BTC
- **Realized Cap**: Better measure of "real" capital invested. Coins that haven't moved in years are valued at their last transaction price, not current price
- **Thermocap Multiple**: Market cap / cumulative miner revenue. Measures how much value the market assigns per dollar of security spend

### Exchange Flows
- **Net exchange flow**: Coins moving to exchanges = selling pressure incoming. Coins moving off exchanges = accumulation (holders moving to cold storage)
- **Exchange reserves**: Total coins held on exchanges. Declining = supply squeeze building. Rising = distribution
- **Stablecoin exchange reserves**: Stablecoins sitting on exchanges = dry powder ready to buy. Rising = buying pressure incoming. This is "sideline cash"

### Whale Tracking
- **Whale wallet concentration**: What % of supply is held by top 100 wallets? High concentration = centralization risk + potential for coordinated dumps
- **Whale accumulation/distribution**: Large wallets adding = bullish signal. Large wallets sending to exchanges = bearish
- **Smart money wallets**: Track wallets that consistently buy bottoms and sell tops. Services like Nansen, Arkham label these

## Tokenomics Evaluation

### Supply Dynamics
- **Total supply vs circulating supply**: If circulating is 20% of total, 80% dilution is coming. When? At what rate?
- **Emission schedule**: Map out token emissions for next 1, 2, 5 years. High inflation tokens need high demand growth to maintain price
- **Inflation rate**: Annual new token emission / circulating supply. >20% = very inflationary (significant sell pressure). <5% = manageable. Deflationary (burns > emission) = supply shrinking
- **Vesting schedules**: Plot all team, investor, ecosystem vesting cliffs on a calendar. Large unlocks = sell pressure events. Check the dates against your investment timeline
- **FDV vs Market Cap**: Fully diluted valuation = price x total supply. If FDV >> market cap, massive dilution ahead. Compare FDV to peers, not market cap

### Token Utility Assessment
Score each from 0-3:
1. **Fee mechanism**: Does holding/staking the token give you fee discounts or earn protocol fees? (0 = no utility, 3 = direct fee sharing)
2. **Staking/Security**: Does the token secure the network via staking? (0 = no, 3 = PoS with real slashing)
3. **Governance**: Does governance actually matter? Can token holders make meaningful changes? (0 = no governance, 1 = cosmetic governance, 3 = controls treasury + protocol parameters)
4. **Burn mechanism**: Are tokens permanently burned from fees/usage? (0 = no burns, 3 = significant % burned annually)
5. **Collateral/Access**: Is the token required to access the protocol? (0 = not needed, 3 = essential for operation)

Total score: <5 = weak tokenomics. 5-10 = decent. 10-15 = strong value accrual.

### The Critical Question
**"Could this protocol work just as well without its own token?"**
If yes → token is likely a value-extraction mechanism, not value-creation. Price is driven purely by speculation.
If no → token has fundamental demand tied to protocol usage. Price has a fundamental floor.

### Real Yield vs Inflationary Yield
- **Real yield**: Protocol earns fees from real usage → distributes to stakers. Sustainable
- **Inflationary yield**: Protocol prints new tokens → distributes to stakers. Ponzi dynamics. Works until it doesn't
- **Test**: Remove token incentives. Does anyone still use the protocol? If TVL drops 80% without incentives, the yield was fake

## Narrative & Cycle Analysis

### Current Narrative Categories
Map each token to its primary narrative:
- **Layer 1s**: ETH, SOL, AVAX, ADA, SEI -- scalability, ecosystem growth
- **Layer 2s**: ARB, OP, BASE, STRK -- Ethereum scaling
- **DeFi**: UNI, AAVE, MKR, CRV -- financial infrastructure
- **AI x Crypto**: RNDR, FET, OCEAN, TAO -- decentralized AI infrastructure
- **DePIN**: HNT, RNDR, FIL, AR -- decentralized physical infrastructure
- **RWA (Real World Assets)**: ONDO, MAPLE, CENTRIFUGE -- tokenizing traditional assets
- **Gaming/Metaverse**: IMX, GALA, AXS -- blockchain gaming
- **Meme/Culture**: DOGE, SHIB, PEPE -- pure sentiment plays

### Narrative Lifecycle
1. **Emergence**: <$1B total narrative market cap. Only crypto-native aware. 100x potential but 90% of projects will die
2. **Growth**: $1-10B. Early mainstream attention. 10-50x for leaders. Risk decreasing but still high
3. **Peak hype**: $10-100B+. Everyone talking about it. Media coverage. New projects launching daily. 2-5x possible but downside significant
4. **Rotation out**: Capital flows to next narrative. -50 to -90% for most. Only fundamentally strong survive
5. **Maturation**: Narrative becomes established sector. Steady growth based on adoption. 2-5x over years

### Position Based on Narrative Stage
- Stage 1-2: Take speculative positions (1-2% portfolio). Research heavily
- Stage 3: If already positioned, trim into strength. If not positioned, too late for asymmetric risk/reward
- Stage 4: Avoid or wait for capitulation. Buy only the strongest survivors
- Stage 5: Core positions in category leaders

## Cycle Awareness

### Bitcoin Halving Cycle (Historical Pattern)
- **Halving**: Mining reward cut in half ~every 4 years. Reduces new supply
- **Historical pattern**: BTC bottoms 12-18 months before halving, tops 12-18 months after
- **2012 halving**: BTC went from ~$12 to ~$1,100 (92x)
- **2016 halving**: BTC went from ~$650 to ~$19,700 (30x)
- **2020 halving**: BTC went from ~$8,800 to ~$69,000 (8x)
- **2024 halving**: Cycle in progress
- **Diminishing returns**: Each cycle, the multiple decreases. Don't expect 2012-level returns
- **Caveat**: Past performance ≠ future results. Pattern may break as market matures and ETF flows dominate

### Altseason Rotation
Typical cycle flow:
1. **BTC leads**: Money enters crypto via BTC first. BTC dominance rises
2. **ETH follows**: Capital rotates BTC → ETH. ETH/BTC ratio rises
3. **Large cap alts**: Capital rotates to SOL, ADA, DOT, AVAX etc
4. **Mid cap alts**: Broader alt rally. More speculative
5. **Micro caps & memes**: Peak speculation. Retail mania. Often signals cycle top
6. **Everything crashes**: BTC drops 50-80%, alts drop 80-95%

### BTC Dominance as Cycle Indicator
- **Rising dominance (BTC outperforming alts)**: Early cycle or risk-off. Accumulate BTC, be cautious on alts
- **Flat dominance**: Mid cycle. Selective alt positioning in strong narratives
- **Falling dominance (alts outperforming BTC)**: Late cycle altseason. Maximum speculation. Start planning exit strategy
- **Dominance bounce after decline**: Altseason ending. Rotate back to BTC or stablecoins

## DeFi-Specific Analysis

### Protocol Revenue Analysis
- **Total revenue**: Fees generated by the protocol from real usage
- **Protocol revenue**: Portion of fees that accrues to token holders (not LPs or users)
- **Price/Revenue (P/S)**: Market cap / annualized protocol revenue. Compare to DeFi peers
- **Revenue growth**: More important than absolute level. 20%+ monthly growth = strong product-market fit

### TVL (Total Value Locked) Analysis
- **TVL trend**: Growing + sticky = real demand. Spiking then collapsing = incentive farming
- **TVL quality**: Is it organic or incentivized? Remove token incentives and see what remains
- **TVL/Market Cap ratio**: >1.0 = potentially undervalued. <0.5 = premium valuation
- **TVL concentration**: Is it all from a few whales or many small depositors? Whale-dominated TVL is fragile

### Smart Contract Risk
- **Audit status**: Multiple audits from reputable firms (Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Certora) = lower risk. No audit = very high risk
- **Time in production**: Longer without exploit = battle-tested. But not immune (see Euler Finance)
- **Bug bounty program**: Large bug bounties signal confidence and attract white-hat security researchers
- **Immutable vs upgradeable**: Immutable = lower admin risk but can't fix bugs. Upgradeable = can fix bugs but admin key risk
- **Admin key controls**: Multisig with timelock = good. Single admin key = rug risk. Fully decentralized = safest but slowest to adapt

### Liquidity & Exit Risk
- **DEX liquidity**: Can you exit a $10K, $50K, $100K position without >2% slippage?
- **CEX listings**: Listed on major exchanges (Binance, Coinbase) = adequate liquidity. DEX-only = higher exit risk
- **Order book depth**: Thin order books = volatile, manipulable. Deep order books = institutional-grade liquidity
- **Lock-up periods**: Staking unstaking periods, LP withdrawal delays. Factor these into risk assessment
