# Macroeconomics & Monetary Policy

## Interest Rate Cycle

### Fed Policy Framework
- **Federal Funds Rate**: The rate banks charge each other overnight. All other rates are built on top of this
- **Dot Plot**: Fed members' projections for future rates. Market-moving when it shifts
- **Fed Funds Futures**: Market's implied probability of rate changes. More accurate than Fed guidance
- **Real rate**: Nominal rate minus inflation. Positive real rates = restrictive. Negative real rates = stimulative
- **Neutral rate (r*)**: The theoretical rate that neither stimulates nor restricts. Currently estimated 2.5-3%

### Rate Cycle Impact on Assets
- **Rate hiking cycle**: Pain for growth stocks (future earnings worth less), long-duration bonds, real estate, crypto. Benefits banks (wider net interest margins), dollar strength
- **Rate cutting cycle**: Risk-on. Benefits growth stocks, crypto, EM equities, long-duration bonds, gold. Hurts dollar, hurts bank margins
- **Pause/plateau**: Market tries to front-run the next move. Look at data to determine if next move is cut or hike

### Yield Curve
- **Normal (upward sloping)**: Long rates > short rates. Economy healthy
- **Flat**: Long rates = short rates. Transition signal. Economy slowing
- **Inverted (2yr > 10yr)**: Recession predictor with 12-18 month lag. Has preceded every US recession since 1955. One false signal (1966)
- **Steepening after inversion**: Often signals recession is imminent or starting. This is when it gets dangerous
- **2yr/10yr spread**: Most watched. Also watch 3mo/10yr (Fed's preferred measure)

## Inflation Regime

### Inflation Components
- **Headline CPI/PCE**: Includes food and energy. Volatile month-to-month
- **Core CPI/PCE**: Excludes food and energy. What the Fed targets (2% PCE)
- **Sticky inflation**: Services, wages, shelter. Slow to change. This is what the Fed worries about
- **Flexible inflation**: Goods, energy, food. Changes quickly. Less concerning
- **Supercore**: Core services excluding shelter. The Fed's laser focus. If this is sticky, no rate cuts

### Inflation Chain Reaction
Rising inflation → Fed hikes → Dollar strengthens → EM currencies weaken → Commodity importing nations hurt → Global growth slows → Commodity demand drops → Inflation moderates → Fed pauses → Cycle reverses

### Leading Indicators for Inflation
- **Commodity prices**: Oil (CPI energy), copper (industrial demand), lumber (housing), agricultural (food CPI)
- **Wage growth**: Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker, ECI. Wages sticky -- once up, hard to bring down
- **Shelter**: Zillow rent index leads CPI shelter by 12 months. Already know where this component is going
- **PPI (Producer Prices)**: Upstream prices that flow into CPI with a lag
- **Supply chain**: ISM supplier deliveries, shipping costs (Baltic Dry Index), container rates

## Economic Cycle

### Where Are We in the Cycle?

**Early Cycle (Recovery)**
- GDP recovering, unemployment falling, profits rebounding
- Best sectors: Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Real Estate, Small Caps
- Credit spreads tightening, yield curve steepening
- Duration: 12-18 months typically

**Mid Cycle (Expansion)**
- GDP growing steadily, unemployment low, profits growing
- Best sectors: Technology, Industrials, Communication Services
- Longest phase, most stocks do well
- Duration: 2-5 years

**Late Cycle (Overheating)**
- GDP decelerating, unemployment very low (labor shortages), wages rising, inflation rising
- Best sectors: Energy, Materials, Healthcare
- Credit spreads starting to widen, yield curve flattening
- Warning signs: consumer confidence peaking, housing starts declining
- Duration: 12-18 months

**Recession (Contraction)**
- GDP declining, unemployment rising, profits falling
- Best sectors: Utilities, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Treasuries, Gold
- Credit spreads wide, VIX elevated, yield curve un-inverting (steepening from front-end)
- Duration: 6-18 months typically

### Key Economic Indicators

**Leading (predict future)**
- ISM Manufacturing PMI: >50 expansion, <50 contraction. Watch the trend direction
- ISM Services PMI: Services = 70% of US economy. More important than manufacturing
- Initial jobless claims: Rising claims = labor market weakening. 4-week moving average smooths noise
- Building permits: Forward-looking housing indicator
- Consumer confidence (Conference Board): Leading indicator for consumer spending
- Yield curve slope: Inverts before recessions
- LEI (Leading Economic Index): Composite of 10 leading indicators. 6+ months of decline = recession warning

**Coincident (confirm present)**
- Nonfarm payrolls: Jobs being added/lost right now
- Industrial production: Current manufacturing output
- Real personal income: Consumer spending power

**Lagging (confirm past)**
- Unemployment rate: Peaks AFTER recession ends. Don't wait for this to act
- CPI: Trails real-time inflation
- Corporate profits (reported): Backward-looking by 1-2 quarters

## Liquidity

### Central Bank Liquidity
- **Fed balance sheet**: QE (buying bonds) = adding liquidity = bullish risk assets. QT (selling/running off bonds) = draining liquidity = headwind
- **M2 money supply**: Historically correlated with asset prices. Rising M2 = more money chasing assets
- **Reverse Repo (RRP) facility**: When high, cash is parked at Fed instead of in markets. Declining RRP = cash flowing into markets (bullish)
- **Bank reserves**: Abundant reserves = easy lending conditions. Scarce reserves = tightening

### Credit Conditions
- **Senior Loan Officer Survey**: Tightening standards = future credit contraction = negative for growth and small caps
- **Credit spreads**: Investment grade and high yield spreads over treasuries. Widening = risk-off. Tight = risk-on/complacency
- **HY OAS (High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread)**: <350bps = very tight (complacent). 350-500 = normal. >500 = stress. >800 = crisis

### Dollar Dynamics
- **DXY (Dollar Index)**: Weighted against EUR (57%), JPY, GBP, CAD, SEK, CHF
- **Strong dollar impact**: Headwind for US multinationals (translation effect), headwind for EM (dollar-denominated debt), headwind for commodities and crypto (priced in USD)
- **Dollar milkshake theory**: US raising rates attracts global capital → dollar strengthens → creates stress in dollar-indebted countries → eventually something breaks
- **Watch**: DXY > 105 creates significant stress for EM and risk assets

## Sector Rotation Model

The economy cycles through phases, and different sectors outperform at each stage:

```
Early Cycle     → Consumer Discretionary, Financials, Real Estate
Mid Cycle       → Technology, Industrials, Communication Services
Late Cycle      → Energy, Materials, Healthcare
Recession       → Utilities, Consumer Staples, Cash, Treasuries
```

### Rotation Signals
- Money flowing from growth → value = late cycle signal
- Money flowing from cyclicals → defensives = recession positioning
- Money flowing from large cap → small cap = early cycle risk-on
- Money flowing from US → international = dollar peaking, global recovery
