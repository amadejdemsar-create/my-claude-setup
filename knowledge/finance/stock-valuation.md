# Sector-Specific Valuation Models

## Universal Valuation Principles

### Relative vs Intrinsic Valuation
- **Relative (comparables)**: Compare to peers using multiples. Fast, market-driven. "Is this stock cheap relative to competitors?"
- **Intrinsic (DCF)**: Discount future cash flows. Fundamental, independent of market. "What is this business actually worth?"
- **Best practice**: Use both. If relative and intrinsic both say cheap → high conviction. If they disagree → dig deeper

### The Right Multiple for the Right Stage
- **Pre-revenue**: EV/TAM penetration rate, comparable transaction multiples
- **High growth (>30% revenue growth)**: EV/Revenue, Rule of 40
- **Growth (15-30%)**: EV/Revenue transitioning to EV/EBITDA, PEG ratio
- **Mature (0-15% growth)**: P/E, EV/EBITDA, FCF yield, dividend yield
- **Declining/Turnaround**: EV/EBITDA, asset value, breakup value

## Technology

### SaaS / Cloud Software
- **Primary metric**: EV/Revenue (NTM forward)
- **Rule of 40**: Revenue growth rate + FCF margin should exceed 40%. Companies above Rule of 40 trade at premium multiples
- **Net Revenue Retention (NRR)**: >120% = excellent (existing customers spending more). >130% = elite. <100% = churn problem
- **Magic Number**: Net new ARR / prior quarter S&M spend. >0.75 = efficient. <0.5 = burning cash to grow
- **CAC Payback**: Months to recover customer acquisition cost. <18 months = good. >24 months = concerning
- **Gross Margin**: >75% expected for pure SaaS. <70% suggests heavy services component
- **Benchmark multiples**: 5-15x EV/Revenue for 20-40% growers. 15-30x for >40% growers with strong NRR

### Semiconductors
- **Primary metrics**: P/E (forward), EV/EBITDA
- **Cyclicality**: Semis are cyclical. Don't buy at peak earnings (low P/E trap -- P/E is low because E is peaking)
- **Book-to-bill ratio**: >1.0 = orders exceeding shipments = demand growing. <1.0 = demand softening
- **Inventory levels**: Industry-wide inventory build = demand pullback coming. Inventory drawdown = recovery
- **Capex cycle**: $100B+ being spent on AI infrastructure. Who captures the most value per dollar spent?
- **Benchmark multiples**: 15-25x P/E for mature (Intel, TI). 25-40x for high-growth (NVDA, AMD in AI cycle)

### Internet / Digital Advertising
- **Primary metrics**: EV/Revenue, P/E, ARPU trends
- **User metrics**: DAU/MAU ratio (engagement), ARPU growth, user growth rate
- **Take rate**: Revenue / GMV for marketplace businesses
- **Network effects strength**: Does the product get better with more users? How defensible?
- **Benchmark multiples**: 3-8x EV/Revenue. Higher for strong network effects + ARPU growth

## Financials

### Banks
- **Primary metric**: Price/Tangible Book Value (P/TBV)
- **ROE**: >12% deserves >1.5x P/TBV. 8-12% = 1.0-1.5x. <8% = below book value
- **Net Interest Margin (NIM)**: Higher rates = wider NIM = more profit. Watch direction not level
- **Efficiency ratio**: Non-interest expense / revenue. <55% = well-run. >65% = inefficient
- **Credit quality**: Non-performing loans (NPL) ratio, loan loss provisions, charge-off rates
- **CET1 ratio**: Common equity tier 1 capital. >10% = well-capitalized. Regulatory minimum ~4.5%
- **Benchmark multiples**: 0.8-1.5x TBV for large banks. 1.0-2.0x for high-ROE regionals

### Insurance
- **Primary metric**: P/Book, combined ratio
- **Combined ratio**: Claims + expenses / premiums. <100% = underwriting profit. >100% = underwriting loss (relying on investment income)
- **Investment portfolio**: Quality and duration matter. Rising rates hurt bond portfolio mark-to-market but help future returns
- **Benchmark multiples**: 1.0-2.0x book for well-run insurers

### Fintech / Payments
- **Primary metrics**: EV/Revenue, P/E, volume growth
- **Payment volume growth**: Visa/Mastercard benefit from cash-to-digital shift
- **Take rate trends**: Rising = pricing power. Falling = competition
- **Benchmark multiples**: 15-30x P/E for mature networks. Higher for disruptors with accelerating growth

## Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals

### Large Pharma
- **Primary metric**: P/E, pipeline DCF
- **Patent cliff analysis**: When do key drugs lose exclusivity? Revenue at risk?
- **Pipeline DCF**: Risk-adjusted NPV of pipeline drugs. Phase 3 = 50-60% probability of approval. Phase 2 = 30%. Phase 1 = 10%
- **R&D productivity**: New drugs approved / R&D spend. Declining industry-wide = more M&A to fill pipelines
- **Dividend safety**: Pharma dividends are sacrosanct. Payout ratio <65% of FCF = safe
- **Benchmark multiples**: 12-18x P/E. Premium for strong pipeline + growing revenue

### Biotech
- **Primary metric**: EV/pipeline value, cash runway
- **Binary events**: FDA approvals/rejections create 30-50% moves. Size accordingly
- **Cash runway**: Months of cash / monthly burn. <12 months = dilution coming
- **Partnership deals**: Upfront payments, milestone payments, royalty rates signal pipeline value

### Medical Devices
- **Primary metrics**: EV/Revenue, P/E
- **Recurring revenue**: Razor/blade model (sell device, recurring consumables). Higher recurring = higher multiple
- **Benchmark multiples**: 4-8x EV/Revenue, 20-30x P/E for quality growers

## Real Estate / REITs

### Key Metrics
- **FFO (Funds From Operations)**: REIT earnings metric. Add depreciation back to net income (buildings don't really depreciate like reported)
- **AFFO (Adjusted FFO)**: FFO minus maintenance capex. Truest measure of distributable cash flow
- **Price/FFO**: REIT equivalent of P/E. 12-18x for most sectors
- **NAV discount/premium**: Market price vs estimated value of underlying properties
- **Cap rate**: NOI / property value. Higher = cheaper/riskier. Lower = expensive/safer. Compare to treasury yields (spread)
- **Occupancy**: >95% = strong demand. <90% = oversupply concerns
- **Lease rollover schedule**: What % of leases expire each year? At what rent vs current market?
- **Debt maturity wall**: REITs are leveraged. Debt coming due in rising rate environment = refinancing risk

### REIT Sectors
- **Industrial (warehouses)**: E-commerce tailwind. Low cap rates = expensive but growing
- **Data Centers**: AI/cloud demand driver. Scarcity premium
- **Residential (apartments)**: Inflation hedge (annual rent increases). Supply wave in some markets
- **Office**: Structurally challenged post-COVID. Avoid unless deep discount + quality portfolio
- **Retail**: Bifurcated. Class A malls doing well. B/C malls dying. Grocery-anchored = stable

## Energy

### Upstream (E&P)
- **Primary metrics**: EV/EBITDA, EV/Reserves (PV-10)
- **Breakeven oil price**: At what oil price does the company break even on FCF? Lower = more resilient
- **Reserve replacement ratio**: Is the company replacing what it produces? >100% = growing resource base
- **Depletion rate**: How fast are reserves declining? High depletion + low replacement = shrinking business
- **FCF yield at current oil price**: >10% = attractive. Check sensitivity to $10/bbl price change

### Midstream (Pipelines)
- **Primary metrics**: EV/EBITDA, distributable cash flow yield
- **Contract structure**: Take-or-pay contracts = stable cash flows regardless of commodity prices
- **Distribution coverage**: DCF / distribution. >1.2x = safe. <1.0x = unsustainable
- **Benchmark**: 8-12x EV/EBITDA, 6-8% yield

### Integrated (Majors)
- **Primary metrics**: P/E, FCF yield, dividend yield
- **Capital discipline**: Are they investing for growth or returning cash? Post-2020 = capital discipline era
- **Downstream cushion**: Refining profits partially offset upstream weakness when oil falls

## Consumer

### Consumer Discretionary
- **Primary metrics**: P/E, EV/EBITDA, same-store sales
- **Same-store sales growth**: Organic growth excluding new locations. >3% = healthy. Negative = demand problem
- **Brand pricing power**: Can they raise prices without losing volume? Measure: price/mix contribution to revenue growth
- **Inventory management**: Inventory growth >> revenue growth = markdowns coming (margin pressure)

### Consumer Staples
- **Primary metrics**: P/E, dividend yield, organic growth
- **Organic growth decomposition**: Volume growth + price growth. Price-only growth is fragile (consumers trade down)
- **Private label threat**: Rising private label penetration in category = pricing power erosion
- **Benchmark multiples**: 18-25x P/E for quality staples (premium for defensive stability)

## Industrials

### Key Metrics
- **Book-to-bill ratio**: Orders / revenue. >1.0 = backlog growing. Strong forward indicator
- **Backlog**: Total unfilled orders. Growing backlog = revenue visibility
- **Capacity utilization**: >80% = pricing power, potential capex for expansion. <70% = excess capacity, pricing pressure
- **Capex cycle positioning**: Are we early (orders recovering), mid (spending accelerating), or late (overcapacity building)?

### Aerospace & Defense
- **Primary metrics**: EV/EBITDA, P/E
- **Backlog years**: Total backlog / annual revenue. 3-5 years = excellent visibility
- **Defense budget trends**: Watch Congressional appropriations, geopolitical tensions
- **Commercial aviation cycle**: Aircraft orders, delivery backlogs (Boeing, Airbus), airline capex plans
- **Benchmark multiples**: 15-20x P/E for defense primes. Higher for high-growth defense tech
