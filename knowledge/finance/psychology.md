# Market Psychology & Behavioral Finance

## Core Principle
Markets are driven by humans (and algorithms programmed by humans). Understanding crowd psychology, cognitive biases, and sentiment extremes gives you an edge that pure fundamental/technical analysis misses. The best opportunities exist when psychology is most extreme.

## Sentiment Indicators

### Fear & Greed Index (CNN)
- 0-25: Extreme Fear (historically excellent buying zone)
- 25-45: Fear
- 45-55: Neutral
- 55-75: Greed
- 75-100: Extreme Greed (historically time to reduce exposure)
- **How to use**: Not a timing tool by itself. Extreme Fear + fundamental support = high-conviction buy. Extreme Greed + deteriorating fundamentals = reduce

### VIX (Volatility Index)
- <15: Complacency. Low vol = cheap options hedging. Good time to BUY protection
- 15-20: Normal
- 20-30: Elevated fear
- 30-40: High fear (historically good 6-12 month forward returns for buyers)
- >40: Crisis (2008: 80+, 2020 COVID: 82, 2022: peaked 36). These are generational buying opportunities IF financial system isn't breaking
- **VIX term structure**: Contango (front month < back month) = normal. Backwardation (front > back) = panic. Backwardation is a stronger fear signal than VIX level alone

### Put/Call Ratio
- <0.7: Excessive call buying = bullish sentiment extreme = contrarian bearish
- 0.7-1.0: Normal range
- >1.0: Excessive put buying = bearish sentiment extreme = contrarian bullish
- **Equity-only P/C ratio** is cleaner than total (which includes hedging activity)

### AAII Sentiment Survey
- Bull-Bear spread > +30: Excessive optimism (contrarian bearish)
- Bull-Bear spread < -20: Excessive pessimism (contrarian bullish)
- Has correctly flagged major market bottoms (March 2009, March 2020)
- **Key**: Most useful at extremes. Noise in normal range

### Smart Money vs Dumb Money Confidence
- When smart money confidence is HIGH and dumb money confidence is LOW = buy signal
- When smart money confidence is LOW and dumb money confidence is HIGH = danger zone
- Smart money: commercial hedgers (COT data), institutional flows
- Dumb money: retail flows, newsletter sentiment, social media

## Contrarian Investing Framework

### Buffett's Rule Operationalized
"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful."

**Conditions for contrarian buying:**
1. Sentiment at extreme fear (multiple indicators confirming)
2. Asset is fundamentally sound (no permanent impairment)
3. You have a time horizon long enough to wait for recovery (12-24 months minimum)
4. You have the psychological fortitude to buy when everything feels terrible

**Conditions for contrarian selling/reducing:**
1. Sentiment at extreme greed
2. Valuation stretched beyond historical norms (P/E > 2 standard deviations)
3. New investors entering because "it only goes up" (shoeshine boy indicator)
4. Your position has grown to an uncomfortably large % of portfolio

### Magazine Cover Indicator
When a stock, sector, or trend makes the cover of mainstream business magazines (Time, Economist, Bloomberg Businessweek) -- it's usually near the top. By the time general public is excited, smart money has already positioned and is looking for exits.

### Capitulation Signals (Identifying Bottoms)
- Record high daily volume on sharp decline
- Retail fund outflows at record levels
- "Experts" calling for much lower prices
- Good companies down 30-50% with no fundamental deterioration
- Credit spreads peak and start tightening
- VIX spikes to >40 then starts declining
- "I'll never invest in [asset class] again" sentiment widespread

## Cognitive Biases That Destroy Returns

### Anchoring
- **What it is**: Fixating on a reference price. "It was $200, now it's $100, that's cheap!"
- **Reality**: Previous price is irrelevant. Current value based on current fundamentals is what matters
- **Fix**: Analyze each position as if buying today from scratch. Would you buy at current price?

### Recency Bias
- **What it is**: Extrapolating recent past into the future. "It's gone up 3 months, it'll keep going"
- **Reality**: Mean reversion is one of the most powerful forces in markets
- **Fix**: Look at 5-10 year charts, not 3-month charts. Zoom out

### Confirmation Bias
- **What it is**: Seeking information that confirms your existing view, ignoring contradicting evidence
- **Reality**: The best investors actively seek out the bear case for their bullish positions and vice versa
- **Fix**: Before buying, write down the 3 strongest reasons NOT to buy. If you can't refute them, don't buy

### Loss Aversion
- **What it is**: Losses feel 2x more painful than equivalent gains feel good. Causes holding losers too long and selling winners too early
- **Fix**: Pre-define exit criteria BEFORE entering. Use stop losses. Evaluate based on "would I buy this today?" not "I can't sell at a loss"

### Endowment Effect
- **What it is**: Overvaluing something because you own it
- **Fix**: Regular portfolio review asking "if I had cash instead of this position, would I buy it today at this price?"

### Herding
- **What it is**: Following the crowd because safety in numbers feels comfortable
- **Reality**: The crowd is right during trends but catastrophically wrong at turning points
- **Fix**: Have a written investment thesis BEFORE entering. Only exit when thesis is broken, not because others are selling

## Narrative Cycles

### The Lifecycle of Market Narratives
1. **Stealth phase**: Early adopters/visionaries identify the trend. No media coverage. Best risk/reward
2. **Awareness phase**: Smart money enters. Some media coverage. Still early
3. **Mania phase**: General public enters. Wall-to-wall media. FOMO. Valuations disconnected from fundamentals. "This time is different"
4. **Blowoff top**: Parabolic rise. Retail euphoria. Everyone is an expert. "Easy money"
5. **Crash**: -50% to -90% from peak. Denial → anger → bargaining → depression
6. **Despair**: "X is dead." Media coverage negative. Capitulation selling. Previous believers become critics
7. **Rebuilding**: Actual utility develops away from speculation. Survivors emerge stronger
8. **New normal**: Sustainable growth based on real adoption. Next cycle begins

### Historical Examples
- **Dot-com (1995-2003)**: Internet is real, but 1999-2000 valuations were insane. Amazon -95%. But Amazon survived and 100x'd
- **Housing (2003-2011)**: "Housing never goes down" + financial engineering = systemic crisis
- **Crypto (2017-2018)**: ICO mania. 95% of tokens went to zero. Bitcoin -84%. But blockchain survived
- **COVID growth stocks (2020-2022)**: "Digital transformation" justified any valuation. Then rates rose and reality hit
- **AI (2023-?)**: Real technology revolution. Question is valuation, not viability. Watch for signs of Phase 3→4 transition

## Position Psychology

### Pre-Trade Checklist
Before entering ANY position:
1. What's my thesis? (Write it down in 1-2 sentences)
2. What would invalidate this thesis? (Define the stop)
3. What's my target? (Define the reward)
4. Is R/R at least 3:1?
5. How much am I willing to lose? (Size accordingly)
6. What's my time horizon?
7. Am I acting on analysis or emotion?

### Warning Signs You're Trading Emotionally
- Checking prices more than twice a day
- Inability to sleep due to positions
- Adding to losers without fundamental reason ("averaging down" emotionally)
- Revenge trading after a loss
- FOMO buying after missing a move
- Changing your thesis to justify not selling
- Position size that makes you uncomfortable
