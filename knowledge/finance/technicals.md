# Technical Analysis Patterns & Indicators

## Core Principle
Price action reflects all known information plus collective sentiment. Technical analysis is about reading the aggregate behavior of all market participants and identifying high-probability setups where risk/reward is asymmetric.

## Trend Analysis

### Moving Averages
- **50 DMA**: Medium-term trend. Institutional traders watch this. Stock above 50 DMA = healthy
- **200 DMA**: Long-term trend. The line in the sand. Stock below 200 DMA = in a downtrend
- **Golden Cross**: 50 DMA crosses above 200 DMA. Bullish signal. More reliable on weekly chart
- **Death Cross**: 50 DMA crosses below 200 DMA. Bearish signal. Often a lagging indicator (damage already done)
- **MA Slope**: A flat 200 DMA means no trend. A rising one confirms uptrend. Steepening slope = accelerating trend
- **Price vs MAs**: Price > 50 > 200 = strong uptrend. Price < 50 < 200 = strong downtrend. MAs tangled together = choppy/no trend

### Trend Structure
- **Uptrend**: Higher highs and higher lows. Each pullback holds above the previous low
- **Downtrend**: Lower highs and lower lows. Each rally fails below the previous high
- **Trend break**: First lower low in an uptrend (or first higher high in a downtrend) is a warning, not confirmation. Need follow-through
- **ADX (Average Directional Index)**: >25 = strong trend. <20 = no trend/choppy. Useful for knowing whether to use trend-following or mean-reversion strategies

## Momentum Indicators

### RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- **Overbought (>70)**: Not an automatic sell. In strong uptrends, RSI can stay >70 for weeks. It means momentum is strong
- **Oversold (<30)**: Not an automatic buy. In strong downtrends, RSI can stay <30 for weeks
- **Bullish divergence**: Price makes lower low, RSI makes higher low. One of the most reliable reversal signals
- **Bearish divergence**: Price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high. Momentum fading even as price rises
- **RSI reset**: In uptrends, RSI pulling back to 40-50 and bouncing = healthy reset, buying opportunity

### MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- **Signal line crossover**: MACD crossing above signal line = bullish. Below = bearish
- **Zero line crossover**: MACD crossing above zero = trend shift to bullish
- **Histogram**: Shows momentum acceleration/deceleration. Shrinking histogram = momentum fading before price turns
- **Divergence**: Same principle as RSI divergence but often earlier signal

### Stochastic RSI
- Useful in range-bound markets. Overbought/oversold in ranges = mean reversion setup
- Less useful in trending markets (will give false signals)

## Volume Analysis

### Volume Principles
- **Volume confirms price**: Rising price + rising volume = strong move. Rising price + declining volume = weak move (exhaustion coming)
- **Breakout volume**: Breakouts should have 2-3x average volume to be trustworthy. Low-volume breakouts frequently fail
- **Capitulation volume**: Extremely high volume on a sharp drop = panic selling = potential bottom
- **Dry-up**: Very low volume after a decline = sellers exhausted, base forming

### OBV (On-Balance Volume)
- Running total of volume (adds on up days, subtracts on down days)
- OBV making new highs before price = accumulation happening, price should follow
- OBV diverging from price = smart money distributing or accumulating before price catches up

### Volume Profile
- **Value Area**: Where 70% of volume traded. Acts as magnet (price tends to return)
- **Point of Control (POC)**: Price with most volume. Strongest magnet
- **Low Volume Nodes**: Price levels with little trading. Price moves quickly through these -- they're air pockets
- **High Volume Nodes**: Price levels with lots of trading. Act as support/resistance

## Volatility

### Bollinger Bands
- **Squeeze**: Bands tightening = volatility contracting = explosive move coming (doesn't tell direction)
- **Band walk**: Price hugging upper band in uptrend = strong momentum. Not overbought, just trending
- **Mean reversion**: Price touching lower band in range-bound market = potential buy. Upper band = potential sell
- **Bandwidth**: Measure band width. Historical low bandwidth = breakout imminent

### ATR (Average True Range)
- Measures daily volatility in dollar terms
- Use for stop placement: 2-3x ATR below entry = gives trade room to breathe
- Expanding ATR = increasing volatility. Contracting ATR = decreasing volatility
- Compare ATR to price for relative volatility: ATR/$price = daily % move

### VIX (for broad market context)
- <15 = complacency (market calm, potential for surprise shock)
- 15-20 = normal
- 20-30 = elevated fear
- >30 = extreme fear (historically good time to be buying)
- >40 = crisis level (2008, 2020 COVID, 2022 Ukraine)

## Chart Patterns

### Reversal Patterns
- **Head and Shoulders**: Left shoulder, head (higher high), right shoulder (lower high). Neckline break confirms. Target = head-to-neckline distance projected down
- **Inverse Head and Shoulders**: Mirror image. Bullish reversal at bottoms. One of the most reliable patterns
- **Double Top**: Two failed attempts at same resistance. Bearish. Target = pattern height projected down from neckline
- **Double Bottom**: Two failed attempts at same support. Bullish. Also called "W bottom"

### Continuation Patterns
- **Bull Flag**: Sharp rally, then tight parallel channel pullback (the flag). Break above flag = continuation. Target = flagpole height added to breakout
- **Bear Flag**: Sharp decline, then tight rally (the flag). Break below = continuation
- **Ascending Triangle**: Flat resistance + rising support. Bullish bias. Break above = measured move = triangle height
- **Descending Triangle**: Flat support + falling resistance. Bearish bias
- **Symmetrical Triangle**: Converging trendlines. Can break either way. Volume usually declines into apex

### Breakout Confirmation
- Volume should increase 2-3x on breakout
- Retest of breakout level that holds = strongest confirmation
- Failed breakouts (return below/above level) = powerful moves in opposite direction

## Support & Resistance

### Key Levels
- **Historical pivots**: Previous highs and lows. More touches = stronger level
- **Round numbers**: $100, $50, $200. Psychological significance
- **Fibonacci retracements**: 38.2%, 50%, 61.8%, 78.6%. Most useful in trending markets. 61.8% is the "golden ratio" level -- strongest
- **VWAP**: Volume-weighted average price. Institutional benchmark. Day traders buy below VWAP, sell above. On daily charts, anchored VWAP from key dates (earnings, breakout) is powerful

### Multi-Timeframe Analysis
1. **Weekly chart**: Determine the primary trend direction. Don't fight the weekly trend
2. **Daily chart**: Identify entry timing and key levels
3. **4-Hour chart**: Fine-tune entry/exit
4. **Rule**: All three timeframes should align for highest probability trades. Weekly up + daily pullback to support + 4H reversal signal = ideal entry
