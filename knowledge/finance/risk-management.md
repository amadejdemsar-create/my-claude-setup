# Risk Management & Portfolio Construction

## Core Principle
Risk management is the only edge that compounds. A great stock picker who doesn't manage risk will eventually blow up. A mediocre stock picker with excellent risk management will build wealth over decades. Capital preservation is prerequisite to capital appreciation.

## Position Sizing

### The 2-5% Rule
- Never risk more than 2-5% of total portfolio on a single idea
- "Risk" means max loss if thesis is wrong (entry to stop-loss), not position size
- Example: $100K portfolio, 3% risk = $3,000 max loss per trade
- If stop is 10% below entry → max position = $30,000 (30% of portfolio)
- If stop is 20% below entry → max position = $15,000 (15% of portfolio)

### Conviction-Based Sizing
- **Highest conviction (7-10% of portfolio)**: Deep research, multiple confirming signals, wide moat, great valuation. Rare -- max 3-4 positions at this size
- **Standard conviction (3-5% of portfolio)**: Good thesis, solid fundamentals, reasonable valuation
- **Speculative (1-2% of portfolio)**: Asymmetric upside but high uncertainty. OK if it goes to zero
- **Never**: >15% in a single non-index position

### Scaling In
Don't go all-in at once. Build positions in tranches:
1. **Initial position (1/3)**: Buy when thesis is established
2. **Second tranche (1/3)**: Buy when price confirms (holds support, breaks out, thesis validated by data)
3. **Final tranche (1/3)**: Buy on pullback within established uptrend
- Advantage: Better average price, more information at each stage, psychological comfort

## Stop Loss Strategy

### ATR-Based Stops
- Place stop 2-3x ATR below entry point
- Gives trade room to breathe through normal volatility
- Tighter in low-vol environments, wider in high-vol

### Structure-Based Stops
- Place stop below the last significant swing low (for longs)
- Below the breakout level that initiated the trade
- Below a key moving average (50 DMA for swing trades, 200 DMA for positions)

### Stop Management
- **Initial stop**: Set at entry based on thesis invalidation point
- **Breakeven stop**: Move stop to entry price after position moves 1R in your favor (R = initial risk amount)
- **Trailing stop**: Trail below swing lows in uptrend. Lock in profits while letting winners run
- **Never**: Move stop further away from entry. That's hoping, not risk management

### When NOT to Use Stops
- Long-term holdings in tax-advantaged accounts (retirement) with wide moats
- Dollar-cost averaging programs (regular buying regardless of price)
- Even here, have a "thesis stop" -- if the fundamental thesis breaks, sell regardless

## Portfolio Construction

### Core-Satellite Model
- **Core (60-70%)**: High-conviction, quality companies with wide moats. Long-term holds. Lower turnover. This is the compounding engine
- **Satellite (20-30%)**: Growth opportunities, thematic bets, cyclical plays. Higher turnover. This is the alpha generator
- **Speculation (5-10%)**: Asymmetric bets. Startups, crypto, turnarounds, special situations. Expect 50%+ of these to fail. The winners need to be 5-10x to justify the losers

### Diversification (Real vs Fake)

**Real Diversification (Uncorrelated Drivers):**
- US large cap + international developed + EM equities
- Equities + bonds + real assets + crypto
- Technology + healthcare + financials + energy
- Long positions + some hedges

**Fake Diversification (Same Risk):**
- 5 different AI stocks = one bet on AI
- US tech + US growth = highly correlated
- Multiple crypto altcoins = all correlated to BTC
- "Diversified" ETFs with 40% in top 10 names

**Test**: In a crisis, do your positions all go down together? If yes, you're not diversified

### Rebalancing
- **Quarterly**: Review allocations, trim winners back to target, add to losers (if thesis intact)
- **Threshold-based**: Rebalance when any position drifts >5% from target allocation
- **Tax-aware**: In taxable accounts, use new cash to rebalance rather than selling (avoid capital gains)

## Correlation Management

### Correlation Reality
- In bull markets, correlations are moderate. Diversification works as expected
- In bear markets/crises, correlations spike toward 1.0. Everything goes down together
- **Implication**: True portfolio insurance requires assets with NEGATIVE correlation in crises (treasuries, gold, volatility, cash)

### Crypto Correlation
- BTC correlates with Nasdaq/risk assets (~0.5-0.7 in recent years)
- Altcoins correlate with BTC (0.7-0.9 typically)
- Crypto is NOT an independent asset class for diversification -- it's a high-beta risk asset
- Size crypto allocation accordingly (5-15% of total portfolio, not 50%)

## Drawdown Management

### Response Framework
- **-5%**: Normal volatility. Do nothing. Stay the course
- **-10%**: Review thesis for each position. Is anything fundamentally broken? If not, stay or add
- **-15%**: Stress test: can portfolio survive another -15%? Reduce positions without conviction. Raise cash if concerned
- **-20%**: Significant drawdown. Only hold positions with strongest conviction. Be honest about what's broken vs temporarily impaired
- **-30%+**: Something structural changed OR market is giving generational opportunity. Critical decision point. History says buyers here win if they have 3+ year horizon and assets are fundamentally sound

### Recovery Math (Why Drawdowns Matter)
- -10% requires +11% to recover
- -20% requires +25% to recover
- -30% requires +43% to recover
- -50% requires +100% to recover
- -75% requires +300% to recover
- **Lesson**: Avoiding large drawdowns is more important than capturing every rally

## Risk/Reward Framework

### Minimum R/R Ratio: 3:1
- Only take positions where potential reward is 3x the potential risk
- Risk = entry price to stop-loss (thesis invalidation)
- Reward = entry price to conservative price target
- With 3:1 R/R, you can be wrong 60% of the time and still be profitable

### Expected Value Calculation
For each scenario:
- Bear case: -X% probability Y% = contribution
- Base case: +X% probability Y% = contribution
- Bull case: +X% probability Y% = contribution
- Sum all contributions = expected value
- Only invest when expected value is meaningfully positive

### Kelly Criterion (Simplified)
- Optimal bet size = (probability of winning * win amount - probability of losing * loss amount) / win amount
- In practice, use half-Kelly or quarter-Kelly to account for estimation errors
- Point: even high-conviction bets shouldn't be all-in

## Risk Checklist Before Every Investment

1. How much can I lose? (Define max loss)
2. What's the probability of that max loss?
3. Can I afford that loss without changing my lifestyle or strategy?
4. How correlated is this with my existing portfolio?
5. What's the liquidity? Can I exit quickly if needed?
6. What's the time horizon? Am I patient enough?
7. What would make me sell? (Define exit criteria now)
8. Am I diversified enough after adding this position?
