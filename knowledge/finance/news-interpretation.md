# News Interpretation -- Reading Between the Lines

## Source Hierarchy (Reliability Ranking)

### Tier 1: Primary Sources (Highest Reliability)
1. **SEC filings** (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy statements): Legal documents. Lying here = securities fraud. Most reliable
2. **Earnings call transcripts**: Management speaking under securities law. Listen for tone, hedging language, what they DON'T say
3. **Federal Reserve statements & minutes**: Direct from the source on monetary policy. Every word is deliberate
4. **Economic data releases** (BLS, Census, BEA): Government statistics. Methodology flaws exist but data is objective

### Tier 2: Professional Analysis (High Reliability)
5. **Company press releases**: First-party but spin-optimized. Read the numbers, discount the adjectives
6. **Analyst research reports** (Goldman, JPM, Morgan Stanley): Deep research but conflicted (banking relationships). Best for data, discount the conclusions
7. **Financial investigative journalism** (WSJ, FT, Bloomberg, Reuters): Reputable, fact-checked, but can have editorial bias
8. **Industry reports** (McKinsey, Gartner, IDC): Good for market sizing and trends. Often optimistic on new technologies

### Tier 3: Commentary (Medium Reliability)
9. **Financial commentators** (CNBC, Bloomberg TV): Entertainment first, information second. Useful for gauging mainstream sentiment
10. **Newsletter writers & independent analysts**: Quality varies wildly. Best ones are contrarian with track records
11. **Podcasts & YouTube**: Good for learning frameworks, poor for actionable real-time intelligence

### Tier 4: Social Media (Lowest Reliability, Highest Speed)
12. **Twitter/X financial accounts**: First to break news but also first to spread misinformation. Verify before acting
13. **Reddit (r/wallstreetbets, r/investing)**: Retail sentiment indicator. Useful as contrarian signal at extremes
14. **Telegram/Discord**: Crypto alpha often surfaces here first but manipulation is rampant
15. **TikTok/Instagram finance**: Bottom of the information food chain. If investment advice comes from here, the trade is crowded

## Earnings Call Analysis

### What to Listen For

**Language That Should Concern You:**
- "Challenging macro environment" = demand is weak and they're not sure when it recovers
- "Investing for the long term" = margins are going to compress and we want you to be OK with that
- "One-time restructuring charge" = especially if it's the third "one-time" charge in three years
- "Building a platform" = we don't have product-market fit yet
- "Strategic review of options" = we might sell the company because management is out of ideas
- "Prudent capital allocation" = we're cutting the dividend or buyback
- CFO hedging on guidance = they're worried about the next quarter

**Language That's Bullish:**
- "Ahead of our internal expectations" = beating their own forecasts, not just Wall Street's
- "Seeing accelerating demand" = growth rate is increasing, not just growing
- "Record backlog" = revenue visibility extending
- "Returning excess capital" = generating more cash than they can productively invest, shareholder-friendly
- Raising guidance (especially early in year) = genuine strength, not just sandbagging
- CEO buying stock on open market (check Form 4 filings) = ultimate confidence signal

### CFO vs CEO
- **CEO**: Sells the vision. Naturally optimistic. Discount enthusiasm by 30%
- **CFO**: Reveals the reality. More measured language. Pay more attention to CFO's tone on margins, cash flow, guidance
- **When they disagree**: If CEO is enthusiastic but CFO is hedging, believe the CFO

### What They Don't Say
- Revenue breakdown they used to provide but stopped = that segment is declining
- Metrics they used to highlight (DAU, NRR, bookings) but quietly dropped = metric is deteriorating
- Competitors they used to dismiss but now acknowledge = competitive pressure increasing
- Long-term targets they used to reiterate but now don't mention = targets are at risk

## M&A News Interpretation

### Acquirer Perspective
- **Strategic acquisition at reasonable price** (EV/Revenue < 10x for tech): Positive. Adding capabilities, customers, or markets
- **Large premium acquisition (>40% premium)**: Skepticism warranted. Often value-destructive. Acquirer's stock usually drops
- **"Transformative" acquisition**: Usually means "we're desperate for growth and willing to overpay"
- **Serial acquirer with rising ROIC**: Rare and valuable (Constellation Software, Danaher). Buy-and-build that works
- **Serial acquirer with flat/declining ROIC**: Value destruction through empire building (many legacy tech companies)

### Target Perspective
- **Being acquired at premium**: Windfall for shareholders. But regulatory risk of deal failing = don't buy at acquisition price, buy at a discount for the risk
- **Strategic review announced**: Company is for sale. Stock price becomes a M&A probability calculation, not a fundamentals play
- **Management buying stock before acquisition**: Insider trading if they knew. SEC scrutinizes these patterns

### Deal Failure Risk Factors
- Antitrust concerns (same industry, large market share)
- Cross-border regulatory approvals needed (especially China SAMR)
- Financing contingencies (leveraged deals in rising rate environment)
- Material adverse change clauses (if target's business deteriorates)

## Analyst Reports

### How to Read Them
- **Ignore the rating**: "Buy" ratings outnumber "Sells" 10:1 due to banking conflicts. A "Hold" from an analyst often means "Sell" in reality
- **Read the thesis**: The 2-3 page summary of why the analyst is bullish/bearish. This is where the value is
- **Read the model**: Revenue build, margin assumptions, valuation methodology. Challenge their assumptions
- **Note the changes**: Estimate revisions matter more than the absolute number. Upward revisions = momentum. Downward = deterioration

### Contrarian Signals from Analysts
- **All analysts bullish + stock at all-time high**: No incremental buyer left. Who's left to upgrade? Contrarian bearish
- **Multiple downgrades after 30%+ decline**: Usually late. Smart money already sold. Potential contrarian buy if fundamentals intact
- **Lone wolf analyst with contrarian view**: Worth reading carefully. They might see something consensus misses
- **Initiation of coverage at "Neutral"**: Analyst isn't excited but banking team needs coverage. Genuinely neutral signal

## Macro Headlines

### The Second Derivative Principle
Markets don't trade on the data -- they trade on the CHANGE in data relative to expectations:
- **Inflation at 6% but declining from 7%**: Bullish. Direction matters more than level
- **Unemployment at 4% but rising from 3.5%**: Bearish. Deterioration from good level still bad
- **GDP growth slowing from 3% to 2%**: May be bearish even though 2% is "good" -- it's the deceleration that matters

### "Priced In" Assessment
Before trading on news, ask: Is this already reflected in the price?
- **Widely expected event happens as expected**: No price move. Already priced in
- **Widely expected event doesn't happen**: Big move. Market had positioned for it
- **Unexpected event**: Biggest moves. No one was positioned
- **Rule**: If you read about it in the newspaper, it's probably priced in. The market had the information before you did

### Fed Communication
- Every word in Fed statements is deliberate. They change single words to signal shifts
- "Patient" → "Data-dependent" = hawkish shift
- "Some" members → "Several" members = broadening consensus
- Removing forward guidance = they want optionality (uncertainty increasing)
- Fed speakers contradicting each other = genuine policy debate (not just messaging strategy)

## Crypto News Interpretation

### Bullish Signals (Verify Before Acting)
- **Major exchange listing** (Binance, Coinbase): Short-term pump, often sell-the-news within days. Longer-term positive for liquidity
- **Protocol upgrade shipped on time**: Competent execution. Compare to projects that repeatedly delay
- **Growing developer ecosystem**: GitHub activity, hackathon participation, new projects building on top
- **Institutional adoption**: Custody solutions, ETF inclusion, corporate treasury allocation. Slow but structural
- **Regulatory clarity** (positive): Clear rules > uncertainty. Even strict rules can be bullish if they legitimize the space

### Bearish Signals
- **Team selling tokens**: Check on-chain. Founders/team dumping into rallies = exit liquidity
- **Partnership announcements without substance**: "MOU" (memorandum of understanding) = non-binding. "Strategic partnership" often = nothing meaningful. Check if code is actually integrated
- **High-profile hire from traditional company**: Often signals pivot from building to marketing/legitimacy-seeking. Not inherently bad but watch for substance
- **Airdrop/incentive program launches**: Short-term TVL boost, then mercenary capital leaves. Evaluate sustainable metrics only
- **Bridging to new chains**: If protocol keeps chasing new chains for growth, it may be losing on its home chain

### Red Flags (High Alert)
- **Changing auditors or delays in reporting**: Something they don't want public
- **Centralization events**: Admin keys used, governance override, emergency actions. Understand why
- **Token unlock acceleration**: Changing vesting schedules to release tokens faster = need to sell
- **Loss of key team members**: CTO or lead dev leaving = technical direction uncertain
- **Related-party transactions**: Protocol treasury lending to founder entities. Conflict of interest
- **"Guaranteed" yields >20%**: Where does the yield come from? If you can't explain it, you're the yield (exit liquidity)
- **Aggressive marketing spend**: Protocols spending heavily on influencer marketing, stadium naming rights while product is mediocre = prioritizing hype over substance
