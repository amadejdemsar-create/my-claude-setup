# Fundamental Analysis Frameworks

## Income Statement Analysis

### Revenue Quality
- **Growth rates**: QoQ, YoY, and 3-year CAGR. Accelerating growth > decelerating growth at any level
- **Revenue mix**: Recurring (SaaS, subscriptions) vs one-time. Recurring revenue deserves higher multiples
- **Geographic concentration**: >50% from one region = currency and geopolitical risk
- **Customer concentration**: Top 10 customers >40% of revenue = dependency risk
- **Organic vs acquired growth**: Strip out M&A to see real growth engine

### Margin Analysis
- **Gross margin**: >60% = software/IP business. 30-60% = value-add manufacturing/services. <30% = commodity/distribution. Trending UP = pricing power or mix improvement
- **Operating leverage**: Revenue growing faster than opex = positive operating leverage. This is the sweet spot -- it means the business model scales
- **SGA efficiency**: SGA as % of revenue should decline as company scales. If flat or rising, sales model doesn't scale
- **R&D intensity**: Tech should be 15-25% of revenue. Declining R&D in tech company = milking the franchise, will eventually lose competitiveness
- **Net margin expansion/compression**: Compare to 3yr and 5yr averages. Understand WHY margin is changing

### Earnings Quality
- **EPS growth vs revenue growth**: If EPS growing much faster than revenue, it's buybacks or cost cuts, not real growth. Sustainable for a while but not forever
- **Operating cash flow vs net income**: OCF should be >= net income consistently. OCF << net income = aggressive accounting (capitalized expenses, accruals games)
- **One-time items**: Strip out "restructuring," "impairment," "litigation" charges. If they happen every year, they're not one-time
- **Stock-based compensation**: Add SBC back to see real economic cost. Companies that exclude SBC from "adjusted" earnings are hiding real dilution

## Balance Sheet Analysis

### Liquidity
- **Current ratio**: >1.5 is healthy, <1.0 is concerning (can't cover near-term obligations)
- **Quick ratio**: (Current assets - inventory) / current liabilities. Better than current ratio for companies with slow-moving inventory
- **Cash runway**: For pre-profit companies, cash / monthly burn rate = months until they need to raise (dilutive)

### Leverage
- **Debt-to-equity**: <0.5 conservative, 0.5-1.0 moderate, >1.0 levered. Context matters: utilities and REITs normally run higher
- **Net debt**: Total debt minus cash. Negative net debt = cash-rich fortress balance sheet
- **Interest coverage**: EBIT / interest expense. >5x = comfortable. <2x = distress risk
- **Debt maturity wall**: When does debt come due? Concentration of maturities in rising rate environment = refinancing risk
- **Floating vs fixed rate**: High floating rate exposure in rising rate environment = margin compression

### Asset Quality
- **Goodwill-to-assets**: >40% = company paid premium prices for acquisitions. Risk of future writedowns
- **Inventory trends**: Growing faster than revenue = demand problem or obsolescence risk. Days inventory outstanding (DIO) trending up is a warning
- **Receivables trends**: Days sales outstanding (DSO) growing = customers slow to pay or aggressive revenue recognition
- **Cash conversion cycle**: DIO + DSO - DPO. Shorter = better. Negative (like Amazon) = using supplier float

## Cash Flow Analysis

### Free Cash Flow
- **FCF = Operating CF - CapEx**. This is what actually belongs to shareholders
- **FCF yield**: FCF / market cap. >5% is attractive, >8% is compelling (if sustainable)
- **FCF margin**: FCF / revenue. Compare to net margin. If FCF margin >> net margin, company is overcapitalizing on balance sheet (not necessarily bad)
- **FCF conversion**: FCF / net income. >100% = high quality earnings. <80% consistently = earnings overstated

### Capital Allocation (how management spends FCF)
- **Reinvestment**: High ROIC reinvestment is best use. ROIC > WACC = value creation
- **Buybacks**: Good when stock is undervalued. Destructive when stock is overvalued (most companies buy back at peaks)
- **Dividends**: Signals maturity. Payout ratio <60% is sustainable. Growing dividend streak signals confidence
- **M&A**: Track acquisition ROIC. Serial acquirers with declining ROIC are destroying value
- **Debt reduction**: Especially valuable when leverage is high or rates are rising

### Quality Signals (What Elite Companies Look Like)
- Consistent FCF > Net Income for 5+ years
- ROIC > 15% and expanding
- Revenue growth + FCF margin > 40% (Rule of 40)
- Net debt declining or negative
- Insider buying, not just holding
- Declining share count
- Altman Z-Score > 3 (bankruptcy risk near zero)
- Piotroski F-Score >= 7 (fundamental strength)

## Competitive Moat Assessment

### Moat Types (Durable Competitive Advantages)
1. **Network effects**: Each user makes product more valuable for others (Visa, Meta, exchanges). Strongest moat
2. **Switching costs**: Painful to leave (enterprise software, banking, healthcare systems). Very durable
3. **Cost advantages**: Structural cost advantage competitors can't replicate (scale, location, process). Moderate durability
4. **Intangible assets**: Brands (luxury goods, Coca-Cola), patents (pharma), regulatory licenses (banking, insurance). Duration varies
5. **Efficient scale**: Natural monopoly/oligopoly in limited market. Uneconomic for new entrants (utilities, railroads, exchanges)

### Moat Width Assessment
- **Wide moat**: 2+ moat types, 20+ year durability, ROIC consistently > 2x WACC
- **Narrow moat**: 1 moat type, 10-20 year durability, ROIC consistently > WACC
- **No moat**: No sustainable advantage, ROIC converging to WACC, commodity business
